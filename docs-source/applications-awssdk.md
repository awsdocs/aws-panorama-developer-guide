# Calling AWS services from your application code<a name="applications-awssdk"></a>

You can use the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto\) to call AWS services from your application code\. For example, if your model detects something out of the ordinary, you could post metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, send an notification with Amazon SNS, save an image to Amazon S3, or invoke a Lambda function for further processing\. Most AWS services have a public API that you can use with the AWS SDK\.

The appliance does not have permission to access any AWS services by default\. To grant it permission, [create a role for the application](permissions-application.md), and assign it to the application instance during deployment\.

## Using Amazon S3<a name="applications-awssdk-s3"></a>

You can use Amazon S3 to store processing results and other application data\.

```
import boto3
s3_client=boto3.client("s3")
s3_clients3.upload_file(data_file,
                    s3_bucket_name,
                    os.path.basename(data_file))
```

## Using the AWS IoT MQTT topic<a name="monitoring-messagestream"></a>

You can use the SDK for Python \(Boto3\) to send messages to an [MQTT topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/topics.html) in AWS IoT\. In the following example, the application posts to a topic named after the appliance's *thing name*, which you can find in [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home#/thinghub)\.

```
import boto3
iot_client=boto3.client('iot-data')
topic = "panorama/panorama_my-appliance_Thing_a01e373b"
iot_client.publish(topic=topic, payload="my message")
```

The topic name can be anything\. To publish messages, the device needs permission to call `iot:Publish`\.

**To monitor an MQTT queue**

1. Open the [AWS IoT console Test page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/test)\.

1. For **Subscription topic**, enter the name of the topic\. For example, `panorama/panorama_my-appliance_Thing_a01e373b`\.

1. Choose **Subscribe to topic**\.
