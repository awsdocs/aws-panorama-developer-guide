The software on the AWS Panorama Appliance connects to camera streams, sends frames of video to your application, and displays video output on an attached display\.

After setting up your appliance, you register cameras for use with applications\. You [manage camera streams](appliance-cameras.md) in the AWS Panorama console\. When you deploy an application, you choose which camera streams the appliance sends to it for processing\.
